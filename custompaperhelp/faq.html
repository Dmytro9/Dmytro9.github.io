                                <h5>Q: What makes CustomPaperHelp.com different?</h5>
                                <p>We boast hiring the cream of the writing industry. The majority
                                    of our writers are native English speakers born and raised in
                                    US, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Europe.
                                    We openly state that we do hire ESL writers to satisfy the needs
                                    of ESL students who specifically ask for such writers or editors.
                                    CustomPaperHelp.com is a division of Writing Solutions S.R.L.,
                                    which is vital in terms of the security and protection you are
                                    entitled to, as a client. When your consumer rights are violated,
                                    you have a simple legal recourse and can easily dispute your payment.</p>

                                <h5>Q: How does the process work?</h5>
                                <p>The process is really simple. To hire a writer or editor,
                                    press the Order button on any page of the website and complete
                                    each step of the order form. It is vital that you are as specific
                                    and detailed as possible to eliminate unnecessary questions from
                                    the writer and to avoid future alterations caused by vague instructions.
                                    You will be able to easily upload any additional instructions (photocopies,
                                    pdf files, etc.) while completing the order form. While placing your order,
                                    you can choose a specific writer from the list provided – we have no problem
                                    sharing their amazing credentials. Once you complete the order form,
                                    you will be redirected to the payment page. Make the payment using
                                    your credit/debit card or PayPal account. Once we receive the payment,
                                    we will either start looking for an expert in your specified field
                                    (usually takes no more that 30—60 minutes) or assign the writer
                                    of your choice.</p>

                                    press the Order button on any page of the website and complete
                                    each step of the order form. It is vital that you are as specific
                                    and detailed as possible to eliminate unnecessary questions from
                                    the writer and to avoid future alterations caused by vague instructions.
                                    You will be able to easily upload any additional instructions (photocopies,
                                    pdf files, etc.) while completing the order form. While placing your order,
                                    you can choose a specific writer from the list provided – we have no problem
                                    sharing their amazing credentials. Once you complete the order form,

                                    (usually takes no more that 30—60 minutes) or assign the writer
